/*
 * A run is considered interesting, if at least one of the following conditions is met
 * 	1. The run contains a new pair of channel operations (new meaning it has not been seen in any of the previous runs)
 * 	2. An operation pair's execution counter changes significantly from previous order.
 * 	3. A new channel operation is triggered, such as creating, closing or not closing a channel for the first time
 * 	4. A buffered channel gets a larger maximum fullness than in all previous executions (MaxChBufFull)
